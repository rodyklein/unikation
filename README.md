# Unikation

> Unikation is a human-centered semantic infrastructure.

> In most everyday situations, meaning does not fully circulate between individuals.  
> What appears as understanding often relies on partial alignment, implicit assumptions, and unexamined gaps.  
> These gaps frequently result in misunderstandings that are subtle, persistent, and costly.

> Unikation supports the stabilization and negotiation of meaning in situations where natural language interaction alone proves insufficient, while keeping responsibility for meaning on the human side.

## Overview

Unikation is an infrastructure for the circulation of meaning between individuals.

## Unikation is

- focused on how meaning is negotiated and maintained in situations where two individuals try to understand each other’s meaning
- explicitly pro-technology, using technical systems to support the circulation and clarification of meaning without removing human control
- informed by long-standing low-tech and technical practices used in science, engineering, and other high-alignment domains to cope with the limits of shared language
- concerned with how meaning can circulate, stabilize, and remain negotiable one interaction at a time
- developed through conceptual work and applied experimentation

## Unikation is not

- not a conversational system in which meaning is produced, decided, or owned by the machine itself
- not a rejection of technology, but an effort to deliberately design technical systems that remain accountable to human understanding
- not an attempt to replace natural language, but to support and extend it through hybrid human–technical arrangements
- not a single finished product, but an infrastructure capable of giving rise to multiple concrete implementations, some visible to users, others embedded within broader systems
- not a promise of flawless or absolute alignment, but a way to push alignment further than natural language alone allows, while keeping understanding a human property 

## What is intentionally not documented here

Some aspects of Unikation are intentionally not documented on this site.  
In particular, its relational, reflexive, and experiential dimensions are explored through direct interaction, experimentation, and dialogue rather than formal description.

This page provides a stable point of reference, not an exhaustive account.  
Certain elements of the work remain situational and are meant to be engaged with, not fully specified in advance.
